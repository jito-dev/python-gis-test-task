**Carefully read task and please check the examples of output in the end of the description**

## Task
You have to develop a streets colouring algorithm using python3. Your algorithm should paint lines in the same colour when you think it is a single street.
1. You don't have to match coordinates with streets from real world. Those streets were taken just for example.
2. Don't use any 3-rd party services, you don't need them.
3. Create a solution just based on the information in the file.
4. It's an just an algorithimic task.

## Requirements:
- Don't fork this repo, just create your own.
- Attach result of your solution to repo. Just put an image into repository and name it "solution.png"
- Solution has to generate images large enough to distinguish lines 
- Your repo with solution should contain file with explanation of how your algorithm works (it can be added to README.md with section Explanation)

## Hints
- For plotting purpose you can use 'matplotlib'

## What is not acceptable
- Just randomly colouring lines

**Possible accepted solution**
Possible generated output of the solution. Some of different lines were occasionaly colourized the same color.

**Possible accepted solution**
Possible generated output, but lines have also different line styles.
